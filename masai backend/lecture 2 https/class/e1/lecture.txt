create a server
--> get request from client and i wil send back the response 
--> client can request anytime --> i have to continuously listen on incoming request

--> server it's a process in system (system process), i have to give it a port number.



problem :- every change re-runing the server 
--> external modules : store (npm)=> nodemon
 FIXME:nodemon means =>node mon => node monitor => it will monitor the changes in the file(iska use karna par huma har changes ka bad sever ko rerun nhi karna paraga)


start a backend project
npm init --y

to use nodemon:-
--> add a scripts and run the command


//TODO: FIXME:when using express server

tow thing in our API
--> endpoin like "/cart"
-->  http verbs like "GET"



to test you api's
==> two tools
    1. extension vs code : thunder client
    2. postman FIXME: we can use only postman
